# Hand Off

**No active code issues. Verification batch complete — #43/#45/#48/#53/#54/#59 all CLOSED (fixes in ac75231, unreleased). Remaining: MR !40029 maintainer watch; v1.2.1 release to ship the fixes.**

## Open tasks

1. [ ] **MR !40029 watch**: F-Droid maintainer (linsui) response to the 1.2.0 bump; fdroiddata worktree `~/repos/schurlix/fdroiddata-mr-polished-recognition` at `1c43ae05f` (branch `add-polished-recognition`).
2. [ ] **v1.2.1 release**: master has verification-round fixes (ac75231) beyond v1.2.0 — bump versionCode → tag → release.yml → fdroiddata bump + MR comment. Consider bundling with any linsui feedback.

## Known on-device gotchas (Oplus/OnePlus)

- `adb shell ime …` / `settings put secure …` / `pm grant …` → all blocked (SecurityException). Enable IME + grant mic + set default keyboard via Settings UI only. Verify via `dumpsys input_method | grep polished`.
- HeliBoard's mic uses the system `voice_recognition_service`, NOT the auxiliary IME → use the nav-bar switcher or Fossify Keyboard.
- The IME crashes on `?attr/` theme attrs — only platform attrs / `@null` / explicit colors in IME layouts.
- Diagnostic logs readable via adb: `/sdcard/Android/data/com.georgernstgraf.polishedrecognition/files/logs/` (llm-prompt/llm-response rotating JSON) — no root needed.
- Pulse diagnostics: re-enable the commented `Log.d` block in `PolishedVoiceInputIME.onRmsChanged` (tag `PolishedRMS`).

Last cleared: 2026-08-31 (late — verification batch done, all issues closed, knowledge current).
